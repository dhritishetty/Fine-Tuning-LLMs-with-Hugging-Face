# Fine-Tuning LLMs with Hugging Face

This project demonstrates fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) using the Hugging Face `transformers` library. The model is trained on a custom dataset to adapt it for specific tasks.

## Project Overview

- **Environment:** Google Colab
- **Model:** LLaMA model variant (`aboonaji/llama2finetune-v2`)
- **Objective:** Fine-tune a pre-trained LLaMA model to improve its performance on a specialized dataset.

## Features

- Use of Hugging Face tools to adjust a pre-trained model so it performs better on the specific data.
- Utilization of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient model adaptation.
- Inference using a text-generation pipeline for interacting with the fine-tuned model.

## How to Run

1. **Access the Colab Notebook:** Open the [Fine-Tuning LLMs Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/dhritishetty/f314d6d3e725b5d52cc4d538fdb2938c/fine-tuning-llms-with-hugging-face.ipynb) to view and run the project code directly in Google Colab.

2. **Run the Cells:** Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to install dependencies, load the model, fine-tune it, and perform inference.

3. **Interact with the Model:** After fine-tuning, use the provided code cells to generate text based on prompts and evaluate the model's responses.
